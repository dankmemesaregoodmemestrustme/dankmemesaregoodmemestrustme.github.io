Getting Good

<th>Phew, that was quite a job, fixing everything. How did it start you ask? Well, wise teacher who shall not be named (and they say flattery gets you nowhere) gave us the task of 'Getting Good', which basically means improving overall and is usually used when dominating some dude in deathmatch with instant respawns. What I did was, first, changing my beautiful and majestic GIF of Filthy Frank ([https://media.giphy.com/media/czioUCBoQ3w0o/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/czioUCBoQ3w0o/giphy.gif) youâ€™re welcome) to a slightly inferior but still cool picture of the Dragonborn. I also made all of my blogs suck less. Imagine an epic montage scene but with The Offspring in the background and target setting, wonderful, isn't it. I gave my blogs more appropriate targets and such. In addition to this I made the background look nice. Reflection was very useful, using all of my targets to accomplish something. Overall I feel I did well, using reflection and a massive amount of not-so-responsible risks. I accidently broke my blog. Twice. First time I messed up a massive chunk of the style.css, second time I have no clue what happened but my blog went to default bad looking html, fixing it was accomplished by reverting back to a working save and loosing a bit of progress, albeit it is fixed now. Also sorry for not using the regular template for this blog (insert lame excuse here).</th>
