  <tr>
    <td>I used several colour scheme websites to find a nice red and white, with some hints of black colour scheme. I then edited some of my html code to expand the spreadsheet to a useable size. For this lesson I used Noticing and Accuracy to find small errors and iron them out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the inability to find a good colour scheme quickly along with messing up my table headers. However I did end up fixing this in the long run. The habits I need to work on are Self Control and Thinking flexibly to progress at a faster rate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to use Self control to retain my table headers when adjusting the html code. Next time I will also think more flexibly in order to make decisions faster and better.</td>
  </tr>
