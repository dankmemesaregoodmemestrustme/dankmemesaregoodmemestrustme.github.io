  <td>My main resource was W3schools and Google, it worked pretty well. For this I used Self control to keep to useful sites that I knew would give me the resources I needed.

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spotting patterns in different sections of code and what I could carry across would help my learning. Making links between what code is a success and what syntax rules need to be met would come in handy quite a bit.

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I should try to understand what the code does in greater detail before using it, as this would help in situations where I don't know what to use to accomplish a certain task. Going in-depth with my learning will give it more meaning and make me more successful due to a greater understanding.
