    <td>I Followed the instructions and succeeded in making a website, forking the repository and changing some things to my liking worked the best. (It is also the only way I did it). I perservered through being a massive idiot at some points, I really have no idea how I messed that up to be honest.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to focus on what actual buttons there are on the page because I managed to actually somehow miss the giant 'COMMIT CHANGES' button. I probably also need to plan out my blogs; I have a problem with planning, useful as it is, I just can't seem to make myself do it. Need to work on that. </td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Use the instructions more and pay attention to what button to press. I will improve my learning by making links between blatetently obvious outcomes and somehow missable giant green buttons. I swear in all the movies with giant buttons it's the first thing you see. </td>
