  <tr>
    <td>I learned that there are two main ways of adding pretty colours and pictures to a blog, the first being in the config file, which used variables and the second being in the style file which directly changed colours using html codes. </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>

  <tr>
    <td>Picture selection was a limit to my progress, I feel I could have got more done if I had chosen a good image to start with, now comes the sad part of the story, it all started one day in an IT lesson where we were making our blogs, for the background image, I chose a GIF or RIck Astley dancing, unfortunately for our protagonist the background was 'horrible' and was forced to be changed. GIF of Rick Astley dancing, gone not forgotten.</td>
