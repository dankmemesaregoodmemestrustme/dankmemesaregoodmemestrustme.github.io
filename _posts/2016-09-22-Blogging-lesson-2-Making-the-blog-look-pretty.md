  <tr>
    <td>I learned that there are two main ways of adding pretty colours and pictures to a blog, the first being in the config file, which used variables and the second being in the style.css file which directly changed colours using html codes. Personally I found the style.css file more adaptive and better to work with. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Picture selection was a limit to my progress, I feel I could have got more done if I had chosen a good image to start with, now comes the sad part of the story, it all started one day in an IT lesson where we were making our blogs, for the background image, I chose a GIF or RIck Astley dancing, unfortunately for our protagonist the background was 'horrible' and was forced to be changed. GIF of Rick Astley dancing, gone not forgotten. Probably a bit more self control and less Rick Astley would be a good habit to work on. Yeah, I'll go with that. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will find a suitable image faster in order to get on with the rest of my blog earlier. If i thought more flexibly, I would be able to achieve greater outcomes faster.</td>
